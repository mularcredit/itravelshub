# Amadeus API Credentials (for Flight Search)
# Get your free API keys at: https://developers.amadeus.com/
# After registration, create a self-service app to get these credentials

AMADEUS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
AMADEUS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# Note: If these keys are not provided, the app will use mock flight data
# This allows you to test the UI without API credentials
